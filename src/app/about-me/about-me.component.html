                Hi, my name is Marco Thiele and I am a junior frontend developer based in Freiberg, Germany. When I was a kid I use to spend every minute on my computer. But growing up in a small village I never even knew that there is the opportunity to become a developer. So it remained a childhood dream.

                    <p>Long story short, at the end of 2022 I decided that I need a change and took the chance to make my dream come true. I started training as a frontend developer. I realized pretty quickly that I never had a job that brings me so much joy. </p>

During the training I coded alone as well in a team.<br> When Iâ€™m not at the computer, you can find me in the gym doing kickboxing and bjj or traveling the world. </p>
